# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `hmlib/`: Primary Python library and CLI entry points (e.g., `hmlib.cli.hmtrack`). Packaged via Bazel wheel rules.
- `src/`: Ancillary modules (`core/`, `users/`) used by higher-level code.
- `tests/`: Bazel `py_test` targets and simple runtime checks.
- `tools/`, `scripts/`: Bazel helpers, formatting utilities, and dev scripts.
- `assets/`, `external/`, `openmm/`, `cmake/`: Assets and native/C++ build integration.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Build all: `bazelisk build //...` (or `bazel build //...`).
- Run tests: `bazelisk test //...`.
- Coverage report: `./coverage.sh` (generates HTML in `reports/coverage/`).
- Apply formatters: `./format.sh` (Black/isort via Bazel aspect).
- Run a Bazel target: `./run.sh //path:target --args`.
- Package wheel: `./run.sh //hmlib:bdist_wheel`.
- Run tracker locally (example): `EXP_NAME=dev VIDEO=video.mp4 ./hm_run.sh`.
 - Exclude wheels: `bazelisk build --config=no-python-wheels //...` (or `./bld --no-python-wheels`).

### Handy local debugging command

- Run TensorRT-enabled tracking on a short clip (5s) for `chicago-3`:
  - `PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python hmlib/cli/hmtrack.py --game-id=chicago-3 --async-post-processing=0 --async-video-out=0 --show-scaled=0.5 --camera-ui=1 --detector-trt-enable --detector-static-detections --detector-static-max-detections=800 --plot-tracking -t=5`

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python: Black (see `pyproject.toml`) and isort; run `./format.sh` before committing.
- Before finalizing changes, run `python -m black` and `ruff check` on any modified/new Python files and fix issues until clean.
- Typing: mypy is configured; prefer typed public APIs in `hmlib/`.
- Naming: modules and functions `snake_case`; classes `PascalCase`; constants `UPPER_SNAKE`.
- C/C++: follow `.clang-format`; standard set to C++17 in CMake.
- Indentation: use spaces (not tabs) in all source files (Python/C/C++/JS/HTML/CSS/etc). Tabs are only allowed where they have special meaning (e.g., Makefiles).

## Error Handling & CLI Args
- Never silently fail. Avoid `except Exception: pass`, bare `except:`, silent fallback-to-default behavior, or catching-and-returning-success. If a best-effort path is genuinely required, surface it explicitly with context so the caller/user can tell the degraded path was taken.
- For CLI argument access: never use `getattr(args, "flag", default)` (or `hasattr(args, ...)`) to paper over missing argparse attributes. Define all expected args in the parser (with defaults) and access via `args.flag`; if an attribute is missing, that's a bug (use subparsers or separate namespaces if modes differ).

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: pytest conventions are supported; prefer test functions named `should_*` (see `pyproject.toml`).
- Location: add tests under `tests/` or as Bazel `py_test` targets alongside code.
- Run: `bazelisk test //...` for CI-equivalent runs; use `./coverage.sh` to inspect branch coverage locally.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: concise, imperative subject (e.g., `fix(hmlib): handle empty frames`). Prefix with scope when helpful (`hmlib/`, `tools/`, `build/`).
- PRs: include a clear description, linked issues, what/why, and test evidence (logs, sample outputs). Update docs when behavior changes.
- Create regular PRs, not draft PRs, unless the user explicitly asks for a draft.
- Use task-focused branch names without AI/tooling prefixes such as `codex/`.
- Do not mention AI agents or coding tools in PR titles or descriptions; PR comments may mention them when useful.
- Assets: do not commit large datasets or model weights; use `datasets/` and `pretrained/` symlinks.

### Nested repositories and submodules

- Treat every nested Git repository as an independent repository with its own commit and remote.
- Commit and push changes from the innermost repository outward. Never record a submodule pointer to a child commit that has not been pushed.
- After pushing a child repository, stage its updated gitlink in the immediate parent, commit and push that parent, then repeat for every containing superproject until the outermost repository is updated.
- Before finishing, verify that each repository in the chain points at the intended child commit and that no task-related changes remain uncommitted.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Keep `hmlib/config/baseline.yaml` byte-for-byte synchronized with HockeyMONStream's `configs/baseline.yaml`. `stitching.control_point_execution_provider` defaults to `cuda` (`cpu` is an explicit alternative without a UI switch). `stitching.control_point_resolution` is the native HStream matcher setting (`2k` is the default on every platform, including missing or `auto` settings; explicit `native`/`1k` choices remain available); its runtime policy is documented in that repository's `docs/native-feature-matchers.md`.
- The shared `stitching.rink_mask_frame_time` and rink-profile field configure native HStream final-mask sampling: `null` inherits, `auto` uses the first stitched frame, and negative `HH:MM:SS[.mmm]` is relative to the synchronized recording end. TV Dublin defaults to `-00:00:01`; Python mask sampling is unchanged. Runtime ownership and UI overrides are documented in HockeyMONStream's `docs/rink-mask-frame-time-design.md`.
- The shared baseline also carries HStream's detector menu and the seam settings both applications read: `stitching.blend_mode` defaults to `laplacian`, and `blend_feather_fraction` defaults to `0.05` for the alpha blend. Keep the copies synchronized when either application's defaults change.
- `hmlib/stitching/blend.py` owns the seam blend vocabulary. It accepts the same spellings as HStream's `ParseBlendMode` (case-insensitive, `_` and `-` interchangeable, plus `hard`/`hard-seam` for `gpu-hard-seam`), with `multiblend` as the one HockeyMON-only addition. Absent, null and blank all mean "inherit"; anything else unrecognized raises. `GPU_BLEND_MODES` and `PYTHON_BLEND_MODES` say which modes each renderer can run, and `require_gpu_mode`/`require_python_mode` refuse the rest rather than silently rendering a different seam. `multiblend` is in neither: it names the calibration-time enblend/multiblend binaries, and `create_blender_config` returns a seamless config for it that the Python blender then dereferences. Blending is a render-time choice, so it must stay out of `StitchingSettings`, whose manifest is calibration provenance.
- In the CUDA stitcher bindings, omitting `blend_mode` keeps hm-cupano's encoding where a positive `num_levels` is a pyramid and 0 is a hard seam, so callers that predate the argument are unchanged. A `blend_mode` that is given decides the operator instead, because a caller naming one and getting another is the mismatch the argument exists to prevent; `hmlib` always passes it. `WORKSPACE.bazel`'s `hm-cupano` pin must carry the alpha blend; keep it in step with HockeyMONStream's pin.
- The seam blend lives in the stitching UI (`hmstitch --camera-ui=1`, `StitchUiPlugin`), under the stitched view. It is a persistent game setting, so `hmtrack` honours whatever was set there; `PlayTracker`'s own camera UI has no stitch-settings section today, because the `force_stitching` flag that gates its left/right stitch controls is never enabled. The stitcher is constructed once, so both blend controls are next-run settings. The combo offers only the modes the configured blender can render, and a game config naming any other mode keeps its own marked entry instead of being shown as Laplacian, so picking a supported mode is a real change that reaches the config. The feather control is published only where alpha is selectable. Both controls write back only when the operator moves them: the combo canonicalizes the spelling and the slider quantizes the fraction, so an unconditional write would rewrite values nobody touched.
- Secrets: never commit credentials; prefer environment variables.
- Shared `ice_boundaries` defaults include HStream's four signed pixel mask insets (zero by default) and independent left/right half-box-width sampling offsets. These are player-filter settings, not stitching artifacts; see HockeyMONStream's `docs/rink-extents.md` for native filtering and preview semantics.
- Large files: keep outside the repo (symlinks `datasets/`, `pretrained/`).
- Reproducibility: run via Bazel for consistent tooling; avoid ad‑hoc local installs unless developing isolated modules.

## AspenNet Architecture
- Graph runner built from YAML `aspen.trunks` mapping (`class`, `depends`, `params`, optional `enabled`); missing deps or cycles raise; disabled trunks become no-op stubs to preserve graph shape; graph is exported to `aspennet.dot` on init.
- Execution modes set under `aspen.pipeline`/`threaded_trunks`: sequential topological order by default, or threaded pipeline with one worker per trunk connected by bounded `Queue(queue_size)`; optional per-trunk CUDA streams (`cuda_streams`) wrap each trunk and synchronize before handoff; grad/no-grad follows the `training` flag.
- Context flow: `forward` threads a shared mutable `context` (injects `shared` and `trunks` namespaces); trunks can declare `input_keys`/`output_keys` and, when `minimal_context` is true, only requested keys plus `shared` are passed; outputs update context, `DeleteKey` removes entries, and each trunk's outputs are stored under `context["trunks"][name]`.
- Device selection for stream usage is inferred from `context`/`shared` (`device`, `cuda_stream`, tensor devices) with CUDA current-device fallback; profiling is plumbed through `shared["profiler"]` using trunk `profile_scope`.
- Shutdown: `finalize()` is invoked on trunks if present; DAG is available via `to_networkx`/`to_dot` helpers and `display_graphviz`.
