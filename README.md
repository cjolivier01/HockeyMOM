## System dependencies and native tools

For a fresh Ubuntu/Debian machine you should run, from the repo root:

```bash
./env/install_deps.sh
./build_deps.sh
```

- `env/install_deps.sh` installs the system libraries needed by the native C++ tools used by HockeyMOM:
  - Hugin CLI tools (`pto_gen`, `autooptimiser`, `nona`) for stitching.
  - Enblend/Enfuse and image/codec libraries (tiff, jpeg, png, OpenEXR, FFTW, wxWidgets, etc.).
  - These are required so the Bazel/CMake builds in `external/hugin` and `external/enblend-enfuse` succeed and the CLI binaries can run.
- `build_deps.sh` runs the Hugin Bazel build:
  - Changes into `external/hugin` and runs `bazelisk build //:install_tree`.
  - This drives CMake to build (and stage an install tree for) the Hugin command-line tools.
  - Those tools are then available to `hmcreate_control_points` and `hmstitch` for pano generation.

If you are on a different distro, use `env/install_deps.sh` as a reference list of required packages and install the equivalents manually, then run `./build_deps.sh`.

If you do **not** build these native tools, you will not be able to run Hugin-based stitching from raw left/right videos, but you can still run tracking on an already-stitched panorama (see below).

## Building and running hmtrack and stitching

You can run the CLIs either from an installed wheel (preferred for end users) or directly from this repo for development.

### From an installed wheel (recommended)

After building wheels with `./bdist_wheel` and installing them into your environment (e.g. `pip install dist/hmlib-*.whl dist/hockeymom-*.whl`), the CLI entry points are available on your `PATH`:

```bash
# Full pipeline from a configured game directory (stitch + track)
hmtrack --game-id ev-stockton-1 --output tracking_output-with-audio.mp4

# Explicit stitching step
hmstitch --game-id ev-stockton-1 -o stitched_output-with-audio.mp4
```

### From the repo checkout (no wheel install)

From the repo root you can invoke the same commands via Python modules:

```bash
# Tracking (equivalent to hmtrack)
python -m hmlib.cli.hmtrack --game-id ev-stockton-1 --output tracking_output-with-audio.mp4

# Stitching (equivalent to hmstitch)
python -m hmlib.cli.stitch --game-id ev-stockton-1 -o stitched_output-with-audio.mp4
```

Ensure your `PYTHONPATH` includes the repo root when running directly (for example, see `hm_run.sh` for how we set `PYTHONPATH` in development).

## Running hmtrack with a pre-stitched or panoramic video

If you already have a stitched panorama (for example, produced by `hmstitch` on another machine or by an external tool) and you do not have Hugin/enblend built locally, you can run tracking directly on that video and skip the stitching phase:

```bash
# Using an explicit stitched video (no game-id layout required)
hmtrack --input-video path/to/stitched_panorama.mp4 --output tracking.mp4

# From the repo without installed wheel
python -m hmlib.cli.hmtrack --input-video path/to/stitched_panorama.mp4 --output tracking.mp4
```

Optionally, if you still use a game directory layout under `$HOME/Videos/<game-id>`, you can combine `--game-id` with `--input-video` so the tracker can pick up game-specific config while reading frames from your pre-stitched file.

## Unified Configuration
- HM configs (`hmlib/config/` camera/rink/game/model) and Aspen graph configs (`hmlib/config/aspen/`) can be combined.
- Aspen YAMLs are nested under a top-level `aspen:` key (e.g., `aspen.plugins`, `aspen.inference_pipeline`, `aspen.video_out_pipeline`).
- The CLI merges multiple YAML files in order using `--config` (repeatable). Later files override earlier values and add new fields.
- Backward-compat `--aspen-config` has been removed. Use `--config` exclusively.

Examples
- Single file (everything in one YAML):
  - `./hm_run.sh --config my_unified.yaml`
- Compose baseline + Aspen graph:
  - `./hm_run.sh --config hmlib/config/baseline.yaml --config hmlib/config/aspen/tracking.yaml`
- Add rink- or game-specific overrides after base files:
  - `./hm_run.sh --config base.yaml --config rink/vallco.yaml --config hmlib/config/aspen/tracking_pose.yaml`

YAML structure (snippet)
```yaml
camera:
  name: GoPro
game:
  game_id: 2024-10-01
aspen:
  inference_pipeline: [...]
  video_out_pipeline: [...]
  plugins:
    detector_factory: {...}
    tracker: {...}
```

**AspenNet Execution Modes**
- Normal (sequential): single thread runs plugins in topological order.
  
  ![AspenNet Normal](docs/images/aspennet-normal.svg)

- Threaded + CUDA streams: each plugin executes in its own thread and CUDA stream; queues connect stages.
  
  ![AspenNet Threaded (CUDA streams)](docs/images/aspennet-threaded-streams.svg)

- Threaded without streams: threaded execution on default stream/CPU; same queueing.
  
  ![AspenNet Threaded (no streams)](docs/images/aspennet-threaded-no-streams.svg)

- Configure via YAML `aspen.pipeline`: `threaded: bool`, `queue_size: int`, `cuda_streams: bool`.
- CLI toggles: `--aspen-threaded`, `--aspen-thread-queue-size`, `--aspen-thread-cuda-streams` or `--no-aspen-thread-cuda-streams`.
